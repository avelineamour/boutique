# Luxe Boutique

Luxe Boutique is a Rails web application and fictitious online shop selling luxury self care items. It is designed to replicate a great deal of the real online shopping experience, with a few exceptions, the most glaring one being that it does not take credit card information. The user can add items to their cart, whether signed in or not, sign up or log in with Facebook omniauth, change item quantities, add and save addresses, make orders, view their order histories, and use formerly saved addresses for new orders.

## Why?

This app is a portfolio project requirement of the Flatiron School, but also presented an opportunity to practice creating an application with real world implications.
